Hello. I am currently a first-year PhD student at the [Chair of Discrete Optimization](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/disopt/) within the [Institute of Mathematics](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/sb/research/math/) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), supervised by [Fritz Eisenbrand](https://people.epfl.ch/friedrich.eisenbrand?lang=en).

My research interests are combinatorial optimization and approximation algorithms. 
Recently I have been working on the topics extended from my master thesis, which includes the robustness of matchings, submodular optimization, and stable matchings.
