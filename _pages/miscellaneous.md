I really enjoy doing sports, which include soccer, basketball, tennis, ping-pong, billard (snooker), and many others. 

I enjoy playing video-games. 
Some of my favorites: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Super Mario Odyssey, Slay the Spire, Civilization VI, and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.

A collection of memorable photos of mine: under constructions. -->
